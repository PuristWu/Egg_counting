# YOLOv5-DSE————An Egg counting pipeline in commercial layer farms
- # Motivation
To achieve efficient and intelligent egg counting, YOLOv5-DSE egg counting algorithm is proposed in this study, including an egg counting system built on edge devices in commercial egg farms. In addition, the algorithm has been deployed for testing on the system.

- # Notes
Since the software we developed for the counting system is still under application, the data set, the code of the model including the software and hardware design of the counting system we developed will be open-sourced here after licensing.
